# Smartkart:
Smartkart is a product comparison web application made for people who want to do extensive comparisons before buying anything off the internet. <br/>
This is just a waitlist server I made bcz, "I can". I didn't wanna use waitlist services, so made my own. You can use this code if u someday wanna make your own waitlist. <br/>
PS: Bruh, just use a waitlist service for free, this is dumb! And yeah, I deployed it on Vercel. Yes, servers can be deployed on Vercel.
